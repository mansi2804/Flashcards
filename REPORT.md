## Summary and Reflection

For this flashcard Machine Problem, I made important choices that shaped how it works. I also used the sqflite package to save data, creating separate tables for decks and flashcards that are linked together. This setup made it easier to work with the database. I divided the UI into separate widgets for each page, making the code clearer and easier to manage. However, I struggled with handling database operations asynchronously, particularly with loading states and ensuring the app ran smoothly.

I enjoyed designing the user interface and making it responsive to different screen sizes. However, I found it challenging to ensure the app looked good on all devices. Overall, this project taught me a lot about app design and state management, and Iâ€™m proud of what I accomplished, even with some difficulties.
